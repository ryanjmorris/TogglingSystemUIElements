# Toggling System UI Elements
This is an example of how to toggle between a 'dark'
setting in Android, removing the navigation bar, and
going between fullscreen to coming back to fullscreen.
Basic System functions. Feel free to fork this and play around with what I've created. This will be used in an upcoming tutorial series as well!
